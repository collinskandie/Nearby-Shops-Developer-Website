                  <p>Currently the API Authenticates using Basic Auth and Lacks TLS / SSL Security.
                    Its not safe to run a production version of the app without the TLS encryption.
                    When planning to run a production version please ensure you have TLS encryption before you start.</p>

                </div>




                  <p class="border-top space-1">Installation on Digital Ocean is our recommended way of Installing Nearby Shops backend.
                  Its easy, simple and saves your time ! Installation takes very little time and everything just works out of the box !
                      If you dont have an account on Digital Ocean just go ahead and create an account and then come back here to follow the
                      remaining steps !

                      <br><br>
                      An easy way to Install Nearby Shops backend on digital ocean is by
                      creating a droplet from Nearby Shops starter snapshot image.
                      On Digital Ocean you can get your app up and running in just 5 $ per month hosting fee.
                  </p>



                  <h2 >Step 1 : Request Snapshot Transfer</h2>


                <p >
                  Currently we dont have one-click image for Digital Ocean. So you have to request a droplet snapshot Image.
                    There is nothing complicated about a droplet snapshot ... its just a copy of working installation of Nearby Shops backend.
                    You can create a working installation out of snapshot. And its ready to use with just a little configuration update.
                    <br><br>
                    To request a droplet snapshot transfer you need to have an account on Digital Ocean.
                    If or when you have that ... go to nearby shops forum at this link
                    <a href="https://forum.nearbyshops.org/t/snapshot-transfer-requests/16">
                        https://forum.nearbyshops.org/t/snapshot-transfer-requests/16
                    </a>

                    Here you can make a request for snapshot and we will send you the snapshot image !
                </p>




                <h2>Step 2 : Create a Droplet from Snapshot</h2>


                <p>
                  After you've acquired the snapshot image. You can create a droplet from that snapshot.
                  So just go ahead and create a droplet ... then login to the droplet using SSH and follow the remaining steps.
                  </p>

                  <code class="border-top">
    ssh root@[ip_of_your_new_droplet]
                  </code>
                </pre>


                  <p>You will be asked to provide your password. You will receive the password on your e-mail that
                      you provided for your DO account.
                  </p>





                  <h2>Step 3 : Update API Configuration</h2>


                <p>
                  You have logged in to your droplet using SSH ... now you can update the API configuration to personalize the installation.
                </p>



                  <pre class="card bg-light align-content-start">
                  <span class="fas fa-code p-3">   Code</span>
                  <code class="border-top">
    cd ~/nearbyshops
    sudo nano api_config.properties
                  </code>
                </pre>




                  <p>
                      The instructions to update the API configuration file is provided in the configuration file. Follow these instructions
                      to update the configuration file. You can update the name of your service.
                      Change username and password of the Database to secure your installation.
                      You will also be required to update the API keys to setup integrations. More information on this
                      is provided in the Integrations section.
                      <br><br>
                      After you finish updating the api configuration please restart the process to reflect the changes ! Then check if it
                      has restarted successfully !
                  </p>



                  <pre class="card bg-light align-content-start">
                  <span class="fas fa-code p-3">   Code</span>
                  <code class="border-top">
    sudo systemctl restart nearbyshopsapi
    systemctl status nearbyshopsapi
                  </code>
                </pre>



                  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Step 4 : Setup Third Party Integrations</h2>


                  <p>
                      E-mail and SMS integration is one of the basic requirement to run nearby shops. E-mail and SMS is used to send
                      order status updates to the user. For example : when the order is packed and ready for delivery.
                      The user will get a SMS message or e-mail that his order is packed and ready for delivery.

                      </br></br>
                      Moreover ... E-mail and SMS is also required for user registration.

                      To enable SMS-OTP, Email you need to setup third party integrations.
                      The guide for setting up third party Integrations is provided in the “Integrations” section.
                      </br></br>
                      So head over to integrations guide and follow the instructions.
                  </p>






                  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Step 5 : Configure Domain Name for the API</h2>

                  <p>
                      If you wish to use the API Server for a long duration or for a production usage. You must setup a domain name for the API server.
                      This is necessary because the IP address of the API Server can change when you are doing some maintenance or for any other reason.
                      </br></br>
                      If you dont set a domain name you will have to update the API Server URL on client side every time there is a change in server IP.
                      And this can get really messy and can give you a huge headache and some grey hair ... just joking !
                      </br></br>
                      Therefore you must assign a domain name for the API server.
                      </br></br>
                      An example for the domain name would be  [ api.nearbyshops.org ]
                  </p>





                  <h2 class="space-top-2 text-primary" style="margin-bottom: 0px">Remaining Tasks</h2>



                <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Step 1 : Login as Admin and Update app Service Configuration</h2>


                <p class="margin-top: 30px">
                  After doing all the technical setup you need to setup some basic configuration for the app.
                    Like setting up the country and service name.
                    Setting up the country sets the currency accordingly. So it is very essential that you complete this configuration.
                    <br><br>
                    For setting up the app configuration you will be required to login as admin to the admin app. The credentials for the admin
                    are provided in the api_config.properties available at your api server.
                    <br><br>
                    After you login as admin you need to open service configuration screen in the admin app
                    and update the country and other settings accordingly.
                </p>




                  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Step 2 : Submit your app to Nearby Shops Market Aggregator</h2>


                  <p>
                      Nearby Shops mobile app can be setup in compile time to work in two modes one is single-market mode and another is multi-market mode.
                      In the Single market mode the app is configured to access only a single market. But in multi-market mode the app is configured
                      to access more than one local market each self-hosted by different service providers.
                      In multi-market mode the user can see the list of local markets that is available at his location
                      and he can select any market out the available market.

                      Both multi-market mode and single market mode has their own pros and cons. While single market mode can give you more
                      independence and autonomy but will require a higher marketing budget. While in multi-market mode your market benefit from
                      the popularity of the platform and get free of cost marketing and audience for your app.

                      Moreover multi-market mode is easier to setup and maintain and update the app. While in single -market mode it gets
                      a little more complicated to keep your code in sync with the original codebase and update your app.



                      To get a better understanding let us see another example.
                      A single-market mode is like a wordpress website. While multi-market mode is like medium.com website.
                      Medium.com is a single platform that can contain many different publications while a wordpress website typically
                      consist of only one independent publication.








                  </p>

                  <p>The open-source nature of Nearby Shops enables anyone to customize and create their own local market app.
                      But when we introduced nearby shops we soon realized few of the many problems and issues that we faced.
                      </br></br>
                      A single app was not scalable and could cover just one or few cities. It was difficult for service providers to maintain
                      their apps and keep it updated and in sync with the single original codebase.
                      </br></br>
                      And then we wondered !
                      </br></br>
                      What if the user could have just one app through which he / she can access all the markets across the world.
                      We call this a market aggregator - a single app to access all the markets across the world ! This concept has many benefits !
                      </br></br>
                      1. This would make shopping a more simple, enjoyable and more richer experience for end-user.</br>
                      2. The service providers no longer have to update, customize and maintain their own end-user app.
                      </br>
                      3. Because your market is discoverable from the original nearby shops app it can lower your marketing and publicity cost and
                      give your market a wider - more audience free of cost.
                      </br></br>
                      So with Nearby Shops we are introducing the concept of market aggregator. A market aggregator is an end-user app where
                      the end-user can access multiple markets. All of that with just one single global user credentials.
                      </br></br>

                      The best part about this feature is that it is free of cost for service providers.
                      You can submit your local market on the market aggregator platform without paying any extra charge.
                      </br></br>
                      The market aggregator is funded by donations and whatever little cost that we will incur for infrastructure we believe we can
                      cover it using donations. Therefore we decided its safe to make this feature free of cost.


                      </br></br>
                      But now there comes a question which some of you might be having ?
                      </br></br>
                      What if you dont want to submit your app to the market aggregator and you just want to run
                      your own market. The answer is yes that is possible. Nearby Shops End-User app can be run with single-market mode and multi-market mode.
                      If you choose to run it as single -market mode. You dont have to submit your app to the market ... but you will have to manage the app
                      updates on your own.

                      </br></br>

                      SO now if you are convinced that you want to submit your market on the nearby shops market aggregator ... lets talk about how to
                      do that ?

                      </br></br>
                      to submit your app to the Nearby Shops market aggregator you have to follow these steps
                      </br></br>
                      Step 1 : Go the the api_config.properties file and add "http://sds.nearbyshops.org" to the trusted market aggregators
                      </br></br>
                      So after adding that to your api config file your api_config.properties file would look like !
                      </br></br>

                      Step 2 : submit your market to the market aggregator !
                      Download the Nearby Shops end-user app from the homepage of <a href="http://nearbyshops.org">nearbyshops.org</a>
                      In this app you will see the + button on the markets screen. You will be asked to provide your market url and make
                      a submission.

                      </br></br>
                      Your submission will be reviewed and approved after few hours.

                  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Step 1 : Submit your app to other market aggregators</h2>

                  <p>
                      Theoretically there could be many market aggregators. And technically it is possible for a service provider to submit their app
                      to multiple market aggregators. Nearby Shops is just one of the many market aggregators.
                      </br></br>
                      you simply have to repeat the above procedure for different market aggregators.
                      </br></br>
                      Right now there isnt any other market aggregator but in future we may have ... or if you want to build one you can ...
                      The tutorial for how to build a market aggregator will be provided !
                      </br></br>
                      We want to ensure that their is a level playing field and no vendor lock-in for service providers ... therefore all the
                      technology is made open-source.
                  </p>


                  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Step 2 : Customize the android apps</h2>

                  <p>
                      We recommend service providers to submit your local market to the market aggregator so that you dont have to maintain
                      the android apps and keep it sync with the original codebase.
                      </br></br>
                      But still if you want to have your own custom android app for your local market you can have that too ...
                      </br></br>
                      Nearby Shops comes with three android apps one for Admin, one for shop owner and one for the end-user.
                      To use the app for production use. You can customize the apps with your own brand name, brand logo, colors and graphics.
                      </br></br>
                      The complete guide for customizing the android apps is provided in
                      <a href="customize-apps.html">customize apps</a>
                      guide.
                  </p>



                  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px">Step 3 : Add Swap Space to the API Server</h2>


                  <p>
                      If you wish to use the API server for the long term you need to add some swap space so that you dont face memory shortage.
                      </br></br>

                      </br></br>
                      You can add the swap space by following the instructions in the tutorial given in above link.
